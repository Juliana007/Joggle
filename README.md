Total joggle for all design projects.
My name is Juliana Uzoka. I am from Nigeria, from the South East region known for entreprenueral spirit. I am a journalist and a blogger. I do not have prior knowledge of coding, I love to use my hands; so am keen on going on this adventure to explore my creative abilities and hopefully,this added skill will push me a notch higher as an aspiring digital publisher.
